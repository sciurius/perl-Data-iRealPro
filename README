Music-iRealPro

iRealPro is a songwriting tool / electronic backup band for
iPhone/iPad, Mac OSX and Android that lets you experiment with
advanced chord progressions and arrangements quickly and easily. You
can use iRealPro for songwriting experiments, as accompaniment when
learning new songs or for making backing tracks for your guitar /
saxophone / theremin solos.

iRealPro can import songs in one of two textual formats in the form of
URLs. The 'irealbook' format starts with "irealbook://" and, after
URLdecoding, is easily readable and straightforward to understand. It
is superseded by the 'irealb pro' format, which is proprietary and
uses obfuscation to hide the contents. These URLs start with
"irealb://". iRealPro has stated that although irealb is the official
data format, they will continue supporting irealbook format for import
since there are many, many songs out there on forums that are still in
irealbook format.

Music::iRealPro provides a set of modules that can be used to
programmatically build songs and produce the irealbook URL suitable
for import into iRealPro. There's experimental support for generating
irealb URLs.

Music::iRealPro is built on top of the Music::ChordBot toolkit.
