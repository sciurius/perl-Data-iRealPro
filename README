Music-iRealBook

iReal-B is a songwriting tool / electronic backup band for
iPhone/iPad, Mac OSX and Android that lets you experiment with
advanced chord progressions and arrangements quickly and easily. You
can use iReal-B for songwriting experiments, as accompaniment when
learning new songs or for making backing tracks for your guitar /
saxophone / theremin solos.

iReal-B can import songs in one of two textual formats. The
'irealbook' format is easily readable and straightforward. It is
superseded by the 'irealb' ('irealb pro') format, which is proprietary
and uses obfuscation to hide the contents. iReal-B has stated that
although irealb is the official data format, they will continue
supporting irealbook format for import since there are many, many
songs out there on forums that are still in irealbook format.

Music::iRealBook provides a set of modules that can be used to
programmatically build songs and produce the irealbook formatted data
suitable for import into iReal-B. There's experimental support for
generating irealb formatted data files.

Music::iRealBook is built on top of the Music::ChordBot toolkit.
