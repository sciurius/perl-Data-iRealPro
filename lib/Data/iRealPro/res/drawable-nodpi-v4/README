To enable pixel perfect images some proprietary files from the
iRealPro app are required. For copyright reasons, these files cannot
be included with this program.

The necessary files can be found in the iRealPro APK, folder
res/drawable-nodpi-v4. Just copy these files to this folder and NPP
imaging should be functional.

For the hand-written variant you must add the font file
assets/fonts/Felt-Regular.ttf from the APK to the res/fonts folder.
