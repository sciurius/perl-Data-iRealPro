=head1 DESCRIPTION

iRealPro (previously named iReal-B) is a songwriting tool / electronic
backup band for iPhone/iPad, Mac OSX and Android that lets you
experiment with advanced chord progressions and arrangements quickly
and easily. You can use iRealPro for songwriting experiments, as
accompaniment when learning new songs or for making backing tracks for
your guitar / saxophone / theremin solos.

iRealPro can import songs in one of two textual format formats. The
'irealbook' format is easily readable and straightforward. The
official 'irealb' format is proprietary and uses some form of
scrambling to hide the contents. iRealPro can export songs in the form
of a HTML document that contains the data in big URLs, and some
printable formats.

Data::iRealPro provides a set of modules that can be used to read and
analyse iRealPro songs in URL format and convert them into something
else, like PDF or PNG. A ready-to-use program iRealPro is provided to
perform conversions on the command line.

iRealPro web site: L<http://www.irealpro.com>.

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

functionality.

Image generation requires L<Imager>. This is optional.

The web backend C<irealpro.cgi> and the text converter C<irpcvt>
require L<Template::Tiny>.
