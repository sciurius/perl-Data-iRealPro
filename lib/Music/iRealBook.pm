=head1 DESCRIPTION

iReal-B is a songwriting tool / electronic backup band for
iPhone/iPad, Mac OSX and Android that lets you experiment with
advanced chord progressions and arrangements quickly and easily. You
can use iReal-B for songwriting experiments, as accompaniment when
learning new songs or for making backing tracks for your guitar /
saxophone / theremin solos.

iReal-B can import songs in one of two textual format formats. The
'irealbook' format is easily readable and straightforward. The
official 'irealb' format is proprietary and uses some form of
scrambling to hide the contents. Music::iRealBook provides a set of
modules that can be used to programmatically build songs and produce
the in irealbook formatted data suitable for import into iReal-B.

iReal-B web site: L<http://www.irealb.com>.

Web editor: L<http://www.irealb.com/editor>.

Music::iRealBook is built on top op the Music::ChordBot toolkit.
